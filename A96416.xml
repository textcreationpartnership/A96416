            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Therefore all of you, I humbly be≈øeech you, Rule well within your own Stations and Territories, keep up their good Order and Kingly Government, and in≈øtruct all under you, in Obedience and Duty, in Ju≈øtice and Hone≈øty, to your ≈øelves, and others; and what you expect from them, to you, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that golden Rule, Doing as you would be done by; it does not repent me, th√¥ this be the ≈øecond or third time: I have had it on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that you by your Examples pre≈øs it the more on them, by doing it, and continually practi≈øing the ≈øame, your ≈øelves to tho≈øe above you; e≈øpecially to tho≈øe to whom you owe ≈øubjection, to Kings and to all that are plac'd in Authority under them, and then this will be to the honour of God, to the Advancement of your Religion, to the Well being of your ≈øelves, to the promoting of your Families, to the Benefit of your Neighbours, to the Glory of our Nation, and at la≈øt to your own Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And till you have done all this in your own hou≈øes, be not under any pretence what≈øoever drawn out to the reforming, and new-modelling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is too great a work for every Mechanick or ≈øingle States-man to undertake, ≈øuch grand matters are for the whole Nation to con≈øult on, or at lea≈øt for their Repre≈øentatives imbodyed into one; For what ≈øays the wi≈øe man, that great States man of all others, King <hi>Solomon</hi> by name, That <hi>in the multitude of Coun≈øellors there is (much) ≈øafety</hi>

Grant that the Nation is bad, very bad, but do not you make it wor≈øe by being ≈øo too. Nay further, admit of it, that it not only has a Mote, but a very great Beam in its Eye, that it is not at all ≈øen≈øible of it, and almo≈øt blinded with it, that it begins to be frantick and raving, with its pricking pain; what then, ≈øhall we like Quacks and Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks, long to be medling and tampering with it? No, no! I hope we are all of us ≈øo ingenuous, and I do not at all doubt of it, but that we will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg that there is ≈øomething, th√¥ it be never ≈øo little in our own Eyes, that each ≈øingle per≈øon in the Kingdom would be pleas'd to pluck out that which is in their own, or in their Families; and when we come to ≈øee clearly, by that time there will not be ≈øo much as the lea≈øt Speck, Iota, in the Eye of the Nation left.</p>
            <p>To conclude; We have hitherto been too prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterou≈øly imploy'd, and begun undi≈øcreetly, very odly at the wrong end, as if we would Tile the Hou≈øe, or Thatch it with Straw or Stubble, and then daub up the Walls with our untemper'd Mortar, and not only ≈øo, but to hang it too in the fleeting Air by Geometry, before we have ≈øo much as laid the very foundation, the fir≈øt corner Stone.
